# Task

Create React Context for `<App />` component in a way that `LanguageSelect` and `Description` components won't have any props provided to them from `App`, exception `onChange`. Remove any "prop drilling."

## Bonus/Additional tasks (Optional)

- Add extra language
- Create more than one slide (maybe split dynamically language json for slides?)
- Change React Context to Redux

Live example of this task is on [this page](https://simutis.dev/react-task-1).
